Each one represents a measured distance, $y$, between two different estimates of the center of a galaxy cluster: the location of the presumed central galaxy and a centroid of the diffuse, emissive gas. The context here is that automated algorithms sometimes fail to chose the central galaxy correctly (because of image artifacts or other problems), whereas the gas centroid is more reliable but also more expensive to measure. Therefore, we'd like to use this data set to _characterize the distribution of mis-centerings_ so that the galaxy-based centers can be used for large sample, with the resulting errors propagated forward through future processing, e.g., weak lensing estimates.\n",
