    "This notebook provides some problems for ground-based coaddition and subtraction.\n",

    "We add and subtract images for different purposes: addition to get the benefits of longer exposures and subtraction to reveal what has changed.  However, in order to perform either operation, the following  image characteristics need to be normalized:\n",
    "* Astrometric calibration (i.e. WCS)\n",
    "* Photometric calibration (i.e. Zeropoint)\n",
    "* Background level\n",
    "* Point Spread Function (PSF) (optional for coaddition)\n",
    "\n",
    "For these problems, we'll assume that we have images that have already been normalized for WCS, zeropoint, and background variations.\n",

    "### Problem 1) Expected depth of a coadd\n",
    "\n",
    "In order of magnitude calculations, you may hear people throw around the statement that the depth of a coadd increases by a factor of $\\sqrt{N}$  for N single-epoch images. Where does this come from? Under what conditions is this a good approximation?\n",
